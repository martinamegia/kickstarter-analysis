# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project consists of data analytics and data visualization from crowdfunded data to present to Louise for her play. 

### Purpose

The Purpose of this analysis is to analyze, organize, and sort crowdfunding data to determine factors that would help our client, Louise, in launching her play *Fever*. This analysis will help her make data-driven decisions that will contribute to the success of her play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

I first started with filtering and organizing the data and then create charts out of it. This helped my analysis a lot because I get to see a visual representation of the data. I want to say that the most challenging part is building the countif formula. I wanted to make sure that I would get an accurate result out of the data so I spent a lot of time in correcting the formula by performing a trial-and-error process. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Majority of the plays were launched during May followed by the month of June. 
61% of the theater outcomes are successful and majority were launched during May as well. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The Outcomes based on goals tells me that theaters with a goal of $1000 to $4999, had the most successful launches but failed the most as well. However, theaters with a goal of less than $1000 had the highest success percentage rate compared to all goal ranges and failed/canceled launches. This tells me that theater launches with lower goals were the most successful in committing to their goals. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

There were not enough theaters that had a higher goal range to compare to. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Majority of the plays were launched during May followed by the month of June. 
61% of the theater outcomes are successful and majority were launched during May as well. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The Outcomes based on goals tells me that theaters with a goal of $1000 to $4999, had the most successful launches but failed the most as well. However, theaters with a goal of less than $1000 had the highest success percentage rate compared to all goal ranges and failed/canceled launches. This tells me that theater launches with lower goals were the most successful in committing to their goals. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There were no canceled plays to compare to in our dataset. The most recent theater launches were also dated last 2017. There were also not enough theaters with higher goals to compare to. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Clustered Column and Stacked Bar would also give a clear representation of the data.
